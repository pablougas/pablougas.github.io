      <h3 class="text-h3 mb-2">Hello</h3>
      <p class="text-body2">
        Based in Seattle, Washington, I’m a naturally curious person who is always looking for ways to learn and grow.
        Whether it’s exploring new technologies, diving into complex problems, or expanding my knowledge in unexpected
        areas, I find joy in the process of discovery. I’m constantly seeking to improve and evolve, both personally
        and professionally. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I’m passionate about embracing new
        challenges that help me push my boundaries.

        I love building things, web apps that users love, wood working projects around the house for extra storage,
        but when I'm not building something you can find me usually riding bikes with my kids (when the weather permits),
        diving into their latest curiousity or hobbies (minecraft, rocks and soccer). Much like our home, I thrive in
        environments that encourage growth and foster innovation.
